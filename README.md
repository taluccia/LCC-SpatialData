## Overview

This repo host scripts that clean Legacy Carbon Collaboration (LCC) data. We convert csv files to spatial point data that is used to extract spatial data from several sources that include historical climates data, day of burn, fire weather, stand age, prefire ndvi. 


# Processing steps
1. ExploreData.Rmd - checks and cleans field data csv files
2. spatializeData.Rmd - converts csv file data to spatial points data.
